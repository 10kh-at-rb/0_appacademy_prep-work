# Preflight Practice Problems

## Prepwork

Hey all! **We're super excited that soon you'll be coming to App
Academy!**

We want you to hit the ground running when you arrive; App Academy is
a fast moving course and we want you be prepared and not fall
behind. For that reason, we have compiled prepwork for you to train up
on and start to flex your Ruby muscles.

Students who are successful in the course start the prepwork early; we
strongly recommend that you **start it immediately after being
accepted**. Don't wait until the end to start; you need to practice as
much as you can **before** the course to maximize what you learn
**in** the course.

## Assessments

Completing assessments successfuly is really important in providing
you feedback and helping you to track your progress through the
course. They are meant to help by letting you know if you fall behind
in the course.

**Assessments are very important; students are required to pass
them**. We want everyone to be successful here, but we also don't want
a student to be fall behind to the point where the course is no longer
helping them. If the program is not working for a student or they get
to the point where they can't pair with other students, we do want
them to find another environment where they will be successful.

For that reason, students who fail an assessment will need to make up
the work to keep up with the rest of the class. Students who fail two
assessments will be asked to leave the program.

## Assessment00 and Practice Problems

To make sure people are prepared, **we give everyone the first, simple
assessment before the course begins**. The first assessment is
particularly important; it tells you whether you are ready for the
course. To help you prepare, we've **included 10 practice problems
(and solutions) for you to study**. The practice problems are a little
harder than on the assessment, because we want you to over- rather
than under-prepare :-)

Ideally you will all ace the first assessment. However, if a student
does very poorly, we will probably want to talk with them about
whether they are prepared for the class. We don't want people to start
out already behind.

## Practice problem instructions

The instructions for the practice problems are written inside the spec
files (in the `spec` directory); check those. You can run the specs
for an individual problem like so:

    rake spec spec/00_nearest_larger_spec.rb

You can write your code in the corresponding file in `lib` (e.g.,
`lib/00_nearest_larger.rb`).

Make sure to look at the results it turns back; look at which tests
fail and then start to figure out why.

My advice is to solve them all once, then put your solutions away and
solve them all again. **Practice until you are fluent!**

## Assessment 00 schedule

On **Monday, April 29**, we'll open the window for taking the
assessment00. As with all our assessments, the exercise is timed
(1hr). You'll have until **12:01 AM, Monday, May 06** to complete
it. We want you to complete it a week before class begins so you have
time to further prepare if necessary.

We'll send out a link on Monday with more instructions for requesting
the assessment online.

The assessment mimics the practice problems: it consists of several
problems and their accompanying test specs. Your job it to get the
specs to "go green" and pass (just like with the practice problems.

**So dive into the practice problems and good luck!**
