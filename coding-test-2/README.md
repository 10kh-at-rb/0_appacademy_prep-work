# Coding Challenge II

After you complete the first coding challenge successfully, you'll be
invited to take the second coding challenge. This one will test your
ability to apply basic programming principles to solve somewhat more
complicated problems.

* [Instructions][instructions]
* [Setup Ruby][setup] (recommended)
* [Chris Pine's Learn to Program][chris-pine]
    * Great for beginners; the first eight chapters will be great
      prep.
* [Ruby Monk][ruby-monk]
    * Read up to and including "Introduction To Strings"; "Classes and
      OO Programming" isn't important.
* [AppAcademy: Mini Curriculum][mini-curriculum]
* **[Example practice problems][practice-problems]**
