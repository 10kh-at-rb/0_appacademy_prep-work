# Coding Challenge II

After you complete the first coding challenge successfully, you'll be
invited to take the second coding challenge. This one will test your
ability to apply basic programming principles to solve somewhat more
complicated problems.

* [Instructions][instructions]
* [Setup Ruby][setup] (recommended)
* [Codecademy Ruby Track][codecademy-ruby]
    * Great for beginners; the first seven sections -- through
      "Refactoring" -- will be great prep.
* [Ruby Monk][ruby-monk]
    * Read up to and including "Introduction To Strings"; "Classes and
      OO Programming" isn't important.
* **TODO**: First couple days curriculum
* **[Example practice problems][practice-problems]**
