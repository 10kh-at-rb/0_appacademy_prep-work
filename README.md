# App Academy Prep Work

Hope you're all well! We've got some Ruby prep work that we'd like you
to complete before the class starts so that you're up-to-speed and
ready to hit the ground running!

Prep work is very important so that everyone is prepared for class and
no one starts out behind. Completing and submitting the assignment is
**required** before class starts.

__The most important thing we can tell you: You learn how to code by doing and
making. Reading programming books or watching screencasts will help, but doing
exercises and building small projects is by far the best way to learn.__

## Setup

### Ruby

Perhaps the most direct source on Ruby Setup is part of Chris Pine's
Learn To Program ebook:
[here](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=00).

### Code Editor

You need a proper code editor; notepad or TextEdit won't cut
it. Because we work in pairs, it's important that everyone use the
same text editor. Please use [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/),
since that it what we will have installed in class. Sublime has a free
trial which never expires, so it's almost free that way.

### Terminal

A lot of Ruby development is done at the command line. Mac users can
use Terminal.app.

Windows users can run `cmd`, which is the Windows command line. Run it
by pressing `Windows Key-R` (launches "run program") and typing `cmd`
into the box.

## Required reading

We have some required introductory readings. Make sure to read these;
those that have exercises, do them.

* Peter Cooper's [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/)
 * Your primary resource for learning Ruby.
 * Not free, but worth every penny; required reading.
 * ch1-4
 * ch6 (skip ch5)
 * Just RubyGems (pg. 168-175 in the second edition) from ch7
 * Just Testing (pg. 192-196 in the second edition) from ch8
* JumpstartLabs'
  [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html).
 * Another intro to Ruby with a lot of good intro exercises.
* Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
 * [ch10](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=10)
 * The other chapters mostly cover material from Beginning Ruby,
   though they may be helpful.

## Required Exercises

Practice makes perfect! Do these exercises. You don't have to turn
them in to us, but you will need the practice :-)

* [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
 * ch1-ch10
 * There are a few exercises at the end of each chapter under the heading, "A Few Things to Try"
 * If you've read Beginning Ruby, you'll be well prepared for these.
* Ruby Monk's [Ruby Primer](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1).
 * An interactive introduction to Ruby.

## Need Help?

The first place to start is Google; a huge part of being a good
developer is learning how to find answers to things you don't
know. Many of the best results come from
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). If you don't find what you
need, start a thread there yourself!

A key part of learning programming is learning how to get unstuck. It's going
to be hard going at first, but you're going to get much better at it with
practice!

### Common Methods and Classes

##### Peter Cooper's summary of useful methods and classes

* Beginning Ruby, Appendix B.

##### Ruby Docs

The built-in, basic datatypes (Array, String, Hash) contain many
useful methods that make your life easier. There's a lot of power in
them. The Ruby documentation lists out all these methods:

*  [Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html)
*  [String](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html)
*  [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html)
*  [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html)
 * Array, and Hash both _mixin_ Enumerable, which means you can use
   Enumerable methods when working with either an Array or
   Hash. Enumerable contains many useful methods.

With just these few pages, you will be able to write a lot of powerful
logic/code. Try to be as familiar as you can with these.

## Assignment

Please work on and submit these exercises before you arrive
(submission details are below). **These are required**; we want you to
be ready for class when it starts.

### Test-First Ruby (Alex Chaffee)

[Test-First Ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby) is a great way to test
your Ruby knowledge. It gives you interactive feedback, so you can find and
correct mistakes. It will also give you practice running RSpec tests (complete
level 1 of [CodeSchool's RSpec course](http://rspec.codeschool.com/levels/1)
if you need a refresher on RSpec).

The required exercises are 0-12 and 14. To begin work, go to the github
page and click to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP and open the
contained index.html. This will contain further instructions as to how to
proceed.

When you're finished with Test First Ruby, send it to us (instructions
below).

### Event Manager (JumpstartLabs)

[Event Manager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html)
is a tutorial that walks you through writing your first Ruby
program. Work through the tutorial, writing code. **Type the code
yourself** instead of copy and pasting; that way you'll remember the
commands better.

When you've finished building the Event Manager, send it to us
(instructions below).

## Submitting Your Work

When done, please zip your Test First Ruby folder (complete with
instructions, specs, and your solutions) and mail it to us at
[contact@appacademy.io](mailto:contact@appacademy.io). Please also
attach your Event Manager work.

**You must submit your work to us by 10 days before your cycle is
  scheduled to begin.**

## Optional Supplemental Readings

Below are additional materials that will help you get a leg up on Ruby.

### Introductory

* [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
  Please go through this book if you don't have much experience with the
  command line. 1, 2, 4-7, 10-16 are the essential chapters. 17-19 are
  optional.

### Intermediate

* Peter Cooper's Beginning Ruby
 * ch12: build a larger project in Ruby
* [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/). A good introduction to
  [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) & Ruby.
