## Preflight Checklist

Hope you're all well! We've got some Ruby prep work that we'd like you
to complete before the class starts so that you're up-to-speed and
ready to hit the ground running!

Prep work is very important so that everyone is prepared for class and
no one starts out behind. Completing and submitting the assignment is
**required** before class starts.
