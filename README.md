# App Academy Prepwork

## Coding Challenge I

Below we list some prepwork to complete before taking the first coding
challenge. If you're new to coding, the prepwork is meant to introduce
you to the fundamentals of writing a computer program. After you've
prepared, try out the example problems (and check the solutions!)
before beginning the coding challenge.

* **[Instructions][instructions-1]**
* [Setup Ruby][setup] (optional)
* [Codecademy Ruby Track][codecademy-ruby]
    * Great for beginners; the first seven sections -- through
      "Refactoring" -- will be great prep.
* [Ruby Monk][ruby-monk]
    * Read up to and including "Introduction To Strings"; "Classes and
      OO Programming" isn't important.
* [Basic Ruby Concepts][basic-concepts]
* **[Example Problems][example-problems]**

## Coding Challenge II

After you complete the first coding challenge successfully, you'll be
invited to take the second coding challenge. This one will test your
ability to apply basic programming principles to solve somewhat more
complicated problems.

## Pre-Course Prepwork

Hey all! **We're super excited that soon you'll be coming to App
Academy!**

We want you to hit the ground running when you arrive; App Academy is
a fast moving course and we want you be prepared and not fall
behind. For that reason, we have compiled prepwork for you to train up
on and start to flex your Ruby muscles. **Completing the prepwork is
required**.

Students who are successful in the course start the prepwork early; we
strongly recommend that you **start it immediately after being
accepted**. Don't wait until the end to start; you need to practice as
much as you can **before** the course to maximize what you learn
**in** the course.

* **[Signup for the mailing list][mailing-signup]**
* **[Required readings][pre-course-readings]**
* **[Required homework][homework]**
    * **Your homework is due 3 weeks before your cycle is scheduled to
      begin**. See inside for exact date.
* [Extra resources and documents][extra-resources]
* **[Assessment00][assessment00]**
    * **We will mail you assessment00 2 weeks before your cycle
      begins.**
