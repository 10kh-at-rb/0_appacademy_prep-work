# App Academy Prep Work

Hope you're all well! We've got some Ruby prep work that we'd like you
to complete before the class starts so that you're up-to-speed and
ready to hit the ground running!

Prep work is very important so that everyone is prepared for class and
no one starts out behind. Completing and submitting the preparatory
assignment is **required** before class starts.

__The most important thing we can tell you: You learn how to code by doing and
making. Reading programming books or watching screencasts will help, but doing
exercises and building small projects is by far the best way to learn.__

## Setup

### Ruby

Perhaps the most direct source on Ruby Setup is part of Chris Pine's
Learn To Program ebook:
[here](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=00).

### Code Editor

You need a proper code editor; notepad or TextEdit won't cut
it. Because we work in pairs, it's important that everyone use the
same text editor. Please use [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/),
since that it what we will have installed in class. Sublime has a free
trial which never expires, so it's almost free that way.

## Required reading

We have some required introductory readings. Make sure to read these;
those that have exercises, do them. You are not required to submit
these exercises, but you will need the practice :-)

* Chris Pine's
  [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). This is a great
  intro to programming and Ruby.

* JumpstartLabs'
  [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html).
  Another intro to Ruby with a lot of good intro exercises.

* Ruby Monk's [Ruby Primer](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1). An
  interactive introduction to Ruby. Going over the same intro Ruby
  concepts through a few different resources will help solidify your
  knowledge.
   
* Peter Cooper's [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Ch 1-9,
  12, Appendix B. Light on exercises, but more in depth
  expositions than the average Ruby primer.  After finishing the
  assigned sections from this book, you should be ready to start the
  Test First Ruby + EventManager exercises above.

## Assignment

Please work on and submit these exercises before you arrive
(submission details are below).

### Test-First Ruby (Alex Chaffee)

[Test-First Ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby) is a great way
to test your Ruby knowledge. It gives you interactive feedback, so you
can find and correct mistakes. It will also give you practice running
rspec tests.

The required exercises are 0 - 12 and 14. To begin work, go to the github
page and click to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP and open the
contained index.html. This will contain further instructions as to how to
proceed.

When you're finished with Test First Ruby, send it to us (instructions
below).

### Event Manager (JumpstartLabs)

[Event Manager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html)
is a tutorial that walks you through writing your first Ruby
program. Work through the tutorial, writing code. **Type the code
yourself** instead of copy and pasting; that way you'll remember the
commands better.

When you've finished building the Event Manager, send it to us
(instructions below).

## Submitting Your Work

Post your work to a Github [gist](https://gist.github.com/) (make one gist per
file) so that we can see what you've done! Make sure to pick the language
(i.e., Ruby) so that you get syntax highlighting.

## Optional supplemental readings

Below are additional materials that will help you get a leg up on Ruby.

### Introductory

* [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
  Please go through this book if you don't have much experience with the
  command line. 1, 2, 4 - 7, 10 - 16 are the essential chapters. 17 - 19 are
  optional.

### Intermediate

* [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/). A good introduction to
  [TDD](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) & Ruby.

* Ruby docs (especially
  [Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html),
  [String](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html),
  [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html) and
  [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html)). With just the
  aforementioned pages, you will be able to write a lot of powerful
  logic/code. Try to be as familiar as you can with those (i.e.,
  Array, String, Enumerable + Hash).
