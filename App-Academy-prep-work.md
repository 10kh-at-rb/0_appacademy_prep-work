Hope you're all well! We've got some Ruby prep work that we'd like you to
complete before the class starts so that you're up-to-speed and ready to hit
the ground running!

We'd like you to work through these exercises before you arrive:

* Alex Chaffee's [Test First Ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby).
  Exercises 0-12, 14.
* JumpstartLabs' [Event
  Manager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) 

Post your work to a Github [gist](https://gist.github.com/) (make one gist per
file) so that we can see what you've done! Make sure to pick the language
(i.e., Ruby) so that you get syntax highlighting. Don't just paste your final
answer in though; start using gist from the beginning and edit your gist as
you progress; all your revisions will be tracked and we'll be able to see your
work history!

Here are resources that we'd like you to be comfortable with, and will
be good prep work to tackle before you start the above exercises:

## Intro

* [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
  Please go through this book if you don't have much experience with the
  command line.

* Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). This is a
  great intro to programming and Ruby.

* JumpstartLabs' [Ruby in 100  Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html).
  Another intro to Ruby with a lot of good intro exercises.

* Ruby Monk's [Ruby Primer](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1). An
  interactive introduction to Ruby. Going over the same intro Ruby concepts
  through a few different resources will help solidify your knowledge.

* Peter Cooper's Beginning Ruby Ch 1-9, 12, 15 (optional), Appendix B. Light
  on exercises, but more in depth expositions than the average Ruby primer.
  After finishing the assigned sections from this book, you should be ready to
  start the Test First Ruby + EventManager exercises above.

## Intermediate

* [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/). A good introduction to [TDD](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) & Ruby.

* Ruby docs (especially [Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html),
  [String](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html),
  [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html) and
  [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html)). With just the aforementioned
  pages, you will be able to write a lot of powerful logic/code. Try to be as
  familiar as you can with those (i.e., Array, String, Enumerable + Hash).

## Advanced

* Well Grounded Rubyist Ch 1-6 (optional reference). A deep dive into Ruby.
  More than is needed usually, and sometimes bogged down in an unhealthy
  fascination with obscure syntax, but provides depth if desired.

* Eloquent Ruby (optional). Write idiomatic Ruby.

__The most important thing we can tell you: You learn how to code by doing and
making. Reading programming or watching screencasts will help, but doing
exercises and building small projects is by far the best way to learn.__
