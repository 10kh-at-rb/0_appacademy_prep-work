# App Academy Prep Work

Hope you're all well! We've got some Ruby prep work that we'd like you
to complete before the class starts so that you're up-to-speed and
ready to hit the ground running!

Prep work is very important so that everyone is prepared for class and
no one starts out behind. Completing and submitting the assignment is
**required** before class starts.

__The most important thing we can tell you: You learn how to code by doing and
making. Reading programming books or watching screencasts will help, but doing
exercises and building small projects is by far the best way to learn.__

## Setup

### Ruby

Perhaps the most direct source on Ruby Setup is part of Chris Pine's
Learn To Program ebook:
[here](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=00).

### Code Editor

You need a proper code editor; notepad or TextEdit won't cut
it. Because we work in pairs, it's important that everyone use the
same text editor. Please use [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/),
since that it what we will have installed in class. Sublime has a free
trial which never expires, so it's almost free that way.

## Required reading

We have some required introductory readings. Make sure to read these;
those that have exercises, do them.

* Peter Cooper's [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/)
 * Ch 1-4
 * Ch 6 (skip ch5)
 * Just RubyGems from ch7
 * Just Testing from ch8
 * 12, Appendix B. Light on exercises, but more in depth expositions
   than the average Ruby primer.  After finishing the assigned
   sections from this book, you should be ready to start the Test
   First Ruby + EventManager exercises above.
* JumpstartLabs'
  [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html).
  Another intro to Ruby with a lot of good intro exercises.
* Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
 * [ch10](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=10)
 * The other chapters mostly cover material from Beginning Ruby,
   though they may be helpful.

## Exercises

Practice makes perfect! Do these exercises. You don't have to turn
them into us, but you will need the practice :-)

* [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
 * ch1-ch10
 * Each chapter has a few exercises at the end.
* Ruby Monk's [Ruby Primer](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1).
 * An interactive introduction to Ruby. Going over the same intro Ruby
   concepts through a few different resources will help solidify your
   knowledge.

## Resource

Ruby has lots of methods baked into the basic classes to help you! The
two best ways to find them are Googling (many of the best answers are
on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com)), or by looking at
the Ruby doumentation. Here's some of the most useful Ruby docs:


*  [Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html)
*  [String](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html)
*  [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html)
*  [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html))

With just these few pages, you will be able to write a lot of powerful
logic/code. Try to be as familiar as you can with those (i.e., Array,
String, Enumerable + Hash).

## Assignment

Please work on and submit these exercises before you arrive
(submission details are below). These are required; we want you to be
ready for class when it starts.

### Test-First Ruby (Alex Chaffee)

[Test-First Ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby) is a great way
to test your Ruby knowledge. It gives you interactive feedback, so you
can find and correct mistakes. It will also give you practice running
rspec tests.

The required exercises are 0 - 12 and 14. To begin work, go to the github
page and click to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP and open the
contained index.html. This will contain further instructions as to how to
proceed.

When you're finished with Test First Ruby, send it to us (instructions
below).

### Event Manager (JumpstartLabs)

[Event Manager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html)
is a tutorial that walks you through writing your first Ruby
program. Work through the tutorial, writing code. **Type the code
yourself** instead of copy and pasting; that way you'll remember the
commands better.

When you've finished building the Event Manager, send it to us
(instructions below).

## Submitting Your Work

Post your work to a Github [gist](https://gist.github.com/) (make one gist per
file) so that we can see what you've done! Make sure to pick the language
(i.e., Ruby) so that you get syntax highlighting.

## Optional supplemental readings

Below are additional materials that will help you get a leg up on Ruby.

### Introductory

* [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
  Please go through this book if you don't have much experience with the
  command line. 1, 2, 4 - 7, 10 - 16 are the essential chapters. 17 - 19 are
  optional.

### Intermediate

* Peter Cooper's Beginning Ruby
 * ch12: build a larger project in Ruby
* [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/). A good introduction to
  [TDD](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) & Ruby.
